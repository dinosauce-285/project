            <h3 class="hufcont"> Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder <br> was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; <br> valuing hard work, dedication, patience,
                loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its <br> members. The emblematic animal was a badger, yellow and black were its house colours. The Head <br> of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout</h3>

            <h3 class="slycont"> Slytherin is one of the four Houses at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, founded<br> by Salazar Slytherin. In establishing the house, Salazar instructed the SortingHat to pick <br> students who had a few particular characteristics
                he most valued. Those characteristics <br>include cunning, resourcefulness, leadership, and ambition. Many Slytherin students tend to <br> clique together, often acquiring leaders, which further exemplifies Slytherin's ambitious qualities</h3>

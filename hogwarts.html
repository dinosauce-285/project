                <h3 class="p13"> Hufflepuff was one of the four Houses of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Its founder <br> was the medieval witch Helga Hufflepuff. Hufflepuff was the most inclusive among the four houses; <br> valuing hard work, dedication,
                    patience, loyalty, and fair play rather than a particular aptitude in its <br> members. The emblematic animal was a badger, yellow and black were its house colours. The Head <br> of Hufflepuff was Pomona Sprout, and the Fat Friar was
                    the House's patron ghost.</h3>
